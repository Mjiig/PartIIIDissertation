\chapter{Introduction}
Dependent type theories can be seen as a generalisation of universal algebras in
a natural way, as both similarly describe sets of terms that can be formed with
operators and variables, differing only in that dependent type theories consider
terms under a powerful typing relation, whilst universal algebra terms can be
seen as all being of a single unstructured type. To be more precise, universal
algebras are equivalent to dependent type theories in which a type context can
be described entirely in terms of the number of variables it contains, with no
additional information about the types of those variables.

To capture this generalisation precisely as a theorem we make use of the
categorical models of universal algebras and dependent type theories, Lawvere
Theories and Csystems respectively. Dependent type theories restricted such that
contexts are described entirely by their length are modelled by Csystems
restricted such that their length functions are bijective. Therefore, the
equivalence between universal algebras and this kind of restricted dependent
type theory can be captured by demonstrating an isomorphism between the category
of Lawvere Theories and the category of l-bijective Csystems.

A concrete isomorphism has been described by Voevodsky and Fiore on paper. The
objective of this project was to machine formalise some of the precursors
required to show that these categories are isomorphic, using the
\textit{UniMath} Coq library. 

In order to machine verify this proof a formalisation in Coq is required of
both categories, the two functors making up the isomorphism and proofs that the
functors compose to give the identity in both directions. In this project I have
formalised the category of Lawvere Theories and the definition of the functor
from Lawvere Theories to Csystems on objects.

\subsection*{Notation}
In keeping with the style used by Voevodsky in (CITE)(CITE) and within
\textit{UniMath}, this dissertation represents composition in the slightly
unconventional diagrammatic order, such that for functions $(f\circ g)(x) =
g(f(x))$. In a general category, given the following diagram:
\[
\begin{tikzcd}
    A\ar[r,"f"]&B\ar[r,"g"]&C
\end{tikzcd}
\]
the composition of $f$ and $g$ is written $f\circ g$.
