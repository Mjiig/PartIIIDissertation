\chapter*{\centering Abstract}
This project formalises some of the precursors required to create a machine
checked proof of the isomorphism between the category of Lawvere Theories and
the category of l-bijective Csystems. The definition of a Lawvere Theory, the
category of Lawvere Theories and a functor from the category of Lawvere Theories
to the category of Csystems on objects have all been formalised in Coq, making
use of the \textit{UniMath} library for underlying mathematical definitions,
most notably the definitions of categories and C0-systems.

This dissertation contains an introduction to the relevant theory and
descriptions and explanations of the Coq code used to formalise this concepts.
